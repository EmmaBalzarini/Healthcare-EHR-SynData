<h5>Project Description</h5>
The aim of the project is to build a knowledge graph (KG) concerning healthcare heterogeneous data about patients, professionals, facilities and other entities from European countries with different healthcare systems. This result could be the foundation to create a service which help the citizens to handle their own healthcare data, in a context in which the citizens moves around Europe. <br> <br>
In this project we used syntetic (alrady anonymized) data to create a prototype integration serving this purpose. We followed the iTelos development methodology and improved our soulution incrementaly - starting from hypothetical use cases all the way to the final, exploitable knowledge graph while evaluating each step of the procedure. <br> <br>
This solution can potentially be used in clinics, pharmacies, hospitals and research institutions by various personel. Security and data access aspects have not been covered in this project - the application level exploiting this KG should take care of these.
